In March 2019, I was elected member of the Film Society committee at the University of Surrey. Film Society, or FilmSoc, is a group of students that get together in a lecture theatre twice a week to watch movies.

Along with my other committee members, I launched a revamp of the society's digital presence in time for the start of the new academic year in the autumn of 2019. **This led to our regular attendance at film screenings more than doubling from the previous year.**

## Branding

The first component of this project was a new brand identity, the core of which was a new logo. We needed the logo to work in a wide variety of contexts: on projector screens, event posters and social media platforms. To accomplish this, I designed a logo system that would adapt to work at various sizes and on both light and dark backgrounds, but still feel part of a unified identity.

## Website

Next, we sorely needed a new website. While the old committee did a good job with the tools they had, the old site was out of date, unsightly and not responsive. The new website had to do three things: showcase our upcoming film screenings, provide general information about the society for members and prospective members, and allow people to sign up for our email newsletter.

During the design and development process, I had to operate under a number of constraints unique to this project. You can read more about my technology choices on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/stringlytyped/filmsoc).

## Social media & communications

Finally, we updated our Facebook page with new copy and images to reflect the new FilmSoc brand and started an Instagram account and WhatsApp group chat. I also managed to fix issues that were hindering the delivery of our weekly newsletter.

## Results

As a result of these and other efforts, we now regularly see between 20 and 30 people attend each of our screenings, up from an average of ten.
