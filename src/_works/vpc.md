At the time this was built, Value Pet Clinic sorely needed an updated website. The old site wasn’t responsive (in fact, it didn’t have a mobile version at all) and the visual design was dated.

The home page of the new design uses large moving backgrounds of cute animals to draw visitors in and capture their attention. Copy was re-written to establish a refreshed identity and focus on the company’s vision of affordable, quality care.

A pre-existing system for collecting new client information was rewritten from the ground up in Elixir. The new version is fully responsive and eliminates unnecessary JavaScript dependencies. A new backend system was also designed to allow clinic staff to search for new client forms and make changes if a client made a mistake. When done, the staff member can export the form as a PDF for import into their practice management system.
