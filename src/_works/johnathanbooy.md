As a film composer, Johnathan Booy desired a portfolio website to showcase his work. Working in collaboration with the client, I was able to come up with a single-page design that communicates all the important information and allows visitors to listen to samples of his compositions.

The client uses a custom CMS to add music to his website which can then be played by visitors using a custom media player implemented in JavaScript using YouTube and SoundCloud APIs. For an engaging effect, animations are used throughout the website and play in response to scroll events. These are powered by CSS and JavaScript.
