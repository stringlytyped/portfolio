Lawn Guru is a family-owned landscaping company located in the greater Vancouver area. Recently they underwent a re-branding and needed a new website to match.

## Quote request and lead tracking system

New customers can request a quote for services using an interactive form with custom form controls (shown above). This approach is designed to make the process engaging and fun, rather than a chore.

Once the quote request form is submitted, employees of the company receive a text message (SMS) notification to their phones. Clicking a link in the message takes them directly to a page with the customers' contact details and other information about the lead. This allows them to follow up quickly, even from a job site.

## Design

The website borrows its colours and feel from the new Lawn Guru logo, made by a third-party. The design is responsive and adapts to screen size of the device on which it viewed.

Lawn Guru also launched new lawn care packages at the same time as the website (previously, each lawn care service was priced individually). These are explained through the use of a responsive table which displays each package as a card on smaller devices and a grid on larger devices.

The site is built using HTML, SCSS, Elixir and Phoenix.
